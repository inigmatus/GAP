GAP 1.3
- replaced KAX Huey contract with KAX Continued Vintage Propelator for early vintage planes using a wooden propeller (thanks to SpannerMonkey for KAX Continued)
- added contract to purchase fuel line duct
- added contract to purchase AirplanePlus engine prototye. Tweakscale will be required (recommend 30% scale with 30% engine thrust for Wright Flyer type craft)

GAP 1.2.9
- compatibility upgrade for KSP 1.2 and Contract Configurator 1.20.3
- please remove your current GAP folder and install this new as many contract filesnames were changed, and some disabled until spawn issues with certain props are resolved.
- reduced Mk3 crew cabin test requirement to 10,000m from 20,000m.
- decoupled crew cabin testing from each other, so you can now test crew cabins idependently as you research them, and not in their assumed order.
- Flight 102 requires either mk2 or mk3 cabin to be tested.
- added Cargo directory in Assets for future cargo subassemblies for GAP 1.3.
- readjusted min and max passengers for charters and regular service flights.
- clarified contract titles for Flights 101-103 to inform users that a minimum crew of 3 (two pilots, 1 engineer) is required for all regular service flights.
- removed crew requirements for Charter Flight 5 so that all charter flights only require a pilot and not additional crew.
- cleaned up list code for inbound passenger contracts as some names were duplicated on roster unnecessarily.

8/29/16 GAP 1.2.8
- added 6 cargo bay test contracts under the KAB banner in preparation for GAP 1.3's cargo missions. Enjoy!
- Commented out G force code to work around critical KSP 1.1.3 bug where Kerbals on EVA spike 15+ G force on exit from craft, causing G force limit contracts (most air passenger contracts) to fail prematurely.
- fixed Tourism Plus and Strategia compatibility. GAP now shows up under Pilot Focus when Tourism Plus is also installed.

8/27/16 GAP 1.2.7
- tested fully compatible with KSP 1.1.3, and Contract Configurator 1.18.1
- requires CC 1.18.1 or higher which fixes contract generation with repeatable contracts, and to allow players to access contracts past Charter Flight 4.
- increased all contract payouts, most by as much as 2x as before to make them more worthwhile for the time players will spend in completing them.
- removed Command Seat as a requirement for Car and Bus contracts. Now any vehicle with wheels will work (assuming it can carry the required number of passenger seats).
- fixed economy contracts to give only what you intend to purchase (some contracts accidentally were handing out other parts as well).
- added new GAP logo and introduced contract sort code for Mission Control.

6/20/16 GAP 1.2.6
- 65 total contracts. This release adds 9 contracts: 7 economy contracts (for parts, rather than bundles), 1 starting car contract, and 1 Coast Guard contract for an easier K2 climber rescue version. See notes below.
- Wright Speed 100 now requires Wright 2500m completion (thanks vardicd).
- Added KSP Scout contract for players to build their first car and scout out KSC. This will appear before KSP Tour Bus.
- KSP Tour Bus now rewards 5,000 funds instead of 3,500 funds.
- decreased appearance of KSP Tour Bus contract. If it continues to appear often, it's because you haven't fulfilled requirements (part unlocks or the contracts mentioned below) for other contract types to appear.
- made Charter Flight 4, 5, and Flights 101-103 appear more often since these too are critical to GAP progression and are the repeatable bread and butter of GAP.
- made Glider, First Flight, 2500m, Aerial Island Survey, and Island Prep contracts appear faster. These are one-time contracts anyways and are critical to progressing players in GAP and unlocking dependent contracts.
- fixed KSP Island Preparation contract. Flag goal works and the goal only appears if you have Astronaut Complex level 2.
- removed PQSOffset and randomization from CoastGuard Rescue Climbers contracts to prevent spawn issues of Kerbals with terrain. No more having to dig a materialized Kerbal out of the side of a mountain. It's hard enough already.
- renamed Coast Guard Rescue Climbers to Coast Guard Rescue Climbers (Hard) and increased the reward accordingly.
- added Coast Guard Rescue Climbers. (Easy) (thanks million_lights)
- fixed passenger spawning for Charter Flight 45. (thanks million_lights)
- fixed all KSS Rixx contracts to spawn carrier without exploding. (thanks LupiDragon)

- Wright-Glider and Wright-FirstFlight now recognize Firespitter parts.
- GAP now requires Module Manager (to add part test capability to various aircraft parts)
- added SSI-WrightEngine to sell an Oscar-B fuel tank, a prototype KAX kuey tail rotor (makes for a great early propeller) if a player has KAX installed, and a small air intake.
- reclassified SSI-Loan as an economy contract.
- fixed SSI-Loan status funds symbol.
- fixed SSI-Loan now requires SSI membership before being offered.
- Split out all GAP: Economy contracts to offer separate contracts for prototype parts instead of bundles.
- Fixed Coast Guard Certification - command seat rescuing of Lt. Dan now possible

5/8/16 GAP 1.2.5
- now fully compatible with KSP 1.1.2.
- removed redundant requirements for KAX and SXT parts for Wright-FirstFlight, CoastGuard-Certification, and IslandTours-Shoreline which were breaking GAP on partial KAX or SXT installs.
- re-added craft definition to TourBus contract now that CC bug #462 was fixed several CC releases ago.
- added recognition of Ferram Aerospace Research controllable surfaces for purpose of unlocking Glider and First Flight contracts.
- clarified KSP IslandPrep instructions to leave engineers at waypoints.
- added cfg for Strategia Pilot Focus which if enabled will give bonus rewards for completing GAP contracts. Check out Strategia today!
- set AVC to make GAP compatible for all KSP versions going forward, since this is anticipated and dependent on Contract Configurator compatibility with KSP.
- requires Contract Configurator 1.11.5 or higher

4/26/16 GAP 1.2.4
- all contracts that require wheel technology have (finally) been fixed.
- fixed BDArmory contract exception error when Module Manager is not installed. KSP-IslandLanding should now show up.

4/21/16 GAP 1.2.3
- compatibility pass for KSP 1.1.
- more spelling and grammar fixes.

3/27/16 GAP 1.2.2
- CoastGuard-Certification now requires wheels, and an air breathing engine to make it appear at the same time with with Shoreline Tour.
- equalized contract weights for TourBus, Glider, and First Flight. They should all be equally available now.
- SSI Venture Capital Funding Loan now available at 25% of starting funds, only gives 10k funds instead of full starting funds, and interest charge raised from 25% to 35%. Loan is still interest free for 30 days.
- rebalanced starting economy contracts. Now select from command seat, structural, electric vehicle, or flight control techs.
- corrected grammar and spelling in a few contracts.
- fixed (third time's the charm?) AVC. (1.2.1 did not include the GAP.version file so if you're running 1.2.1 you will not know that newer GAP versions are out. Sorry!)

3/22/16 GAP 1.2.1
- corrected grammar and spelling in a few contracts.
- fixed SSI-Glider to now require a Command Seat tech before being made available in Mission Control.
- removed conflicting AVC file.

3/21/16 GAP 1.2
- requires Contract Configurator 1.9.10
- added Operation: Manley Freedom - a BDArmory contract that appears after you survey the islands. Requires BDArmory and Kerbal Aircraft Expansion. Can you rescue Scott Kerman from the Hackstream brigade?
- added one of three craft definition requirements to all contracts: preflight timer, passenger, or specific part or mission objective completed; to fix all reported mission completion bugs where unintenteded craft used for other contracts were tripping definition parameters for the intended contract, causing some GAP contracts to require the unrelated craft to complete a mission.
- redefined KerbalDeaths to only apply to crew and passengers of a GAP vessel and no other vessel or Kerbal. Finally Joe Kerman dying in the void of space won't affect GAP contracts.
- added static fund rewards to SSI-Glider and SSI-First Flight, and bumped reward for KSP-TourBus, to better balance reward with effort for early contracts, and provide a more balanced starting income stream.
- redeveloped the GAP contract tree from scratch. New dependencies, removed dependencies, and added and removed (combined) contracts to support modularity, simplicity, and expansion.
- removed mission requirement from Join SSI! and added small membership fee as 10% of a player's starting funds. Contract is now required to be accepted before GAP contract tree becomes available. Yes, GAP now costs funds to exploit!
- added GAP:Economy contracts offering simple prototype parts for funds, as well as an SSI Capital Bank Loan contract that loans the amount of a player's starting funds to players that are running at 10% or less of their starting funds. SSI developed parts are no longer free giveaways and require funds to purchase.
- modularized GAP by removing requirements for some contracts. Now you can remove certain GAP expansions (folders) without causing continuity issues. Only the Milestones (GAP Core) and the Assets folder should not be removed as it contains all the core contracts required for GAP and its expansions to function. All other folders may be removed.
- combined KSP-IslandLanding with KSP-IslandPrep. Now it's only one mission, not two.
- moved some contracts to GAP Core: Milestones
- moved some contracts to GAP: Charters and Airlines (requires Milestones)
- moved some contracts to GAP: Stunts (requires Milestones)
- moved some contracts to GAP: Skydiving (requires Milestones) (requires EVA Parachutes)
- moved some contracts to GAP: Seacraft
- moved some contracts to GAP: Coast Guard
- moved some contracts to GAP: Space Shuttle Missions
- moved contracts into folders as part of modularizing GAP for easy removal of certain parts as desired.
- added maxCount to Charter Flight 5 to retire flight once player completes Flight 101.
- redrafted airline flights to allow for more manual loading, and left only manual loading for Charter Flight 4 (passengers) and Charter Flight 40 (science passengers).
- Coast Guard buoys now save as subassemblies rather than showing up in the VAB craft list.
- KSP-TourBus contract now requires a command seat, and any wheels - not just stock or SXT.

1/31/16 GAP 1.1.2
- Kerbals are rather hardy. Bumped Wright-AirplaneRide G limit to 5 Gs (Gimbal line at 5 G is easier to see and watch out for)
- updated KSP-IslandLanding description to require Astronaut Complex building level 2 (flag planting requires Astronaut Complex level 2)
- added language to KSP-IslandSurvey contract completion message informing the player to work on upgrading the Astronaut Complex to level 2
- added land and stop language to contracts since landing is defined as stopping your vehicle's motion while on the ground.
- added requirement to IslandTours-Shoreline to require a boat only, not a seaplane, to prevent players from building seaplanes before Wright-FirstFlight, but encourage boats before.
- removed IslandTours-Shoreline as a requirement for IslandTours-Flight-1, to separate out boat tourist contracts from plane tourist contracts.
- removed antenna check from buoy drop contracts (to avoid an MM patch for compatibility with RemoteTech installs).
- removed waypoint 6 from KSP-IslandSurvey as it now requires player to fly back under waypoint 1 instead (makes waypoint 1 easier to find)
- clarified the air breathing engine parameter check in contracts to include lack of specific fuel types on board in addition to lack of certain engine types (so even modded engines are properly checked)
- fixed KSP-AVC. Now checks for version! (finally)

1/28/16 GAP 1.1.1
- reclassified Jebediah's Tool Shed as a ship rather than base to prevent conflict with severedsolo's Bases contract pack.
- added language to IslandTours-Flight 1 and 2 that a player should fly within 500m above the waypoints, and not under them.
- made KSP-TourBus repeatable.
