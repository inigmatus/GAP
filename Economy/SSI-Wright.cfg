	description = Hello, my name is Orville Kerman, and I and my brother founded Wright Aeronautical. We started out with a bicycle company but have only recently begun exploring the area of aerodynamics. We have recently developed flight control technology that we know will eventually lead to controllable flying machines!\n\nAs a member of SSI, you may purchase the following production-ready prototypes that will allow you to start making flying machines:\n\n- Wing Connector Type E\n- Elevon 4\n- Sepratron I
	
	synopsis = Flight control technology is at your fingertips! Simply cover the cost of our initial production run, and these prototypes will be yours! 
	
	notes = These parts will be available immediately to your organization upon contract acceptance.
	
	completedMessage = Part transfer complete.\n\nYour organization now has access to the following:\n\n- Wing Connector Type E\n- Elevon 4\n- Sepratron I\n\nEnjoy the new parts!
