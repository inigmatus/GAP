GAP is fully stock compatible, however to enhance your experience, we recommend the following mods:
1. Take Command (on CKAN) - spawn Kerbals in Command Seats
2. Kerbal Aircraft eXpansion (KAX) (on CKAN) - stock-alike propellers and engines.
3. EVA Parachutes (on CKAN) - for parachute contracts
4. EVA Parchutes by default (on CKAN) - for parachute contracts
5. BDArmory by BahamutoD - for BDArmory contracts


Download GAP from Github: https://github.com/inigmatus/GAP

To install the contract pack, look for it on CKAN and install it from there (recommended). Else you can simply download the zip and put the GAP folder in your GameData/ContractPacks folder. Launch a KSP career game.
