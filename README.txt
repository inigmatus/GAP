Contract Pack: Giving Aircraft a Purpose
by inigma

(This contract pack requires Contract Configurator. Get it installed from CKAN today for your KSP.)

GAP is fully stock compatible, however to enhance your experience, we recommend the Making History DLC to take advantage of additional flight destinations. 

Regardless if pure stock or DLC, we recommend following mods:

0. Module Manager (required) this is used to validate many contracts. Please include it in your manual installs.
1. Take Command (on CKAN) - spawn Kerbals in Command Seats
2. Kerbal Aircraft eXpansion Continued (KAX Continued) - stock-alike propellers and engines.
3. AirplanePlus - props, jets, wings, cabins, cockpits, and more.



Download GAP from Github: https://github.com/inigmatus/GAP

To install the contract pack, look for it on CKAN and install it from there (recommended). Else you can simply download the zip and put the GAP folder in your GameData/ContractPacks folder. Launch a KSP career game.
