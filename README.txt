Contract Pack: Giving Aircraft a Purpose
by inigma

GAP is fully stock compatible, however to enhance your experience, we recommend the Making History DLC to take advantage of additional flight destinations. 

The following mods are required:
1. Contract Configurator 2.11 from https://github.com/KSP-RO/ContractConfigurator
2. Module Manamger 4.2.3 from https://ksp.sarbian.com/jenkins/job/ModuleManager/

The following mods are recommended for more fun:
1. Kerbal Aircraft eXpansion Continued (KAX Continued) - stock-alike propellers and engines.
2. AirplanePlus - props, jets, wings, cabins, cockpits, and more.

We used to recommend the Take Command mod, however the game now allows you to load crew and tourist Kerbals into Command Seats from the VAB, SPH, and Space Center GUIs from your astronaut roster.
