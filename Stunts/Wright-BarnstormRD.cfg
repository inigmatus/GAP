//CONTRACT DESCRIPTION

	name = Wright-BarnstormRD
	title = Barnstorm the R&D Center!
	group = GAP
	agent = Wright Aeronautical
	
	description = Barnstorm the R&D Center bridge and tunnel? Jebediah thinks it can be done. Gene has signed off on the attempt. Wright Aeronautical thinks it might lead to an air show at some point. At least for now, the cameras won't be rolling in case... well... you get the gist. As a result, to avoid liability, this is a totally self-funded venture, but you will earn a significant amount of reputation and pilot experience if you do both.
	
	synopsis = Go barnstorm the R&D pedestrian bridge. Earn a bonus reputation if you can barnstorm the tunnel too.
	
	notes = Be sure your pilot signs off on the insurance waiver before attempting this one, as it's not covered.
	
	completedMessage = Wow! You did it! Those who saw it were impressed. Well done! Gene says if you ever get tired of doing stunts, there's some important jobs for you at Mission Control if you're interested.
