//CONTRACT DESCRIPTION

	name = Wright-Barnstorm
	title = Barnstorm Jebediah's tool shed!
	group = Wright Aeronautical
	agent = Wright Aeronautical
	
	description = There's an tool shed by the hangar which used to belong to Jebediah Kerman, but is now owned by Wright Aeronautical to store fuel for the aviation program. Jebediah thinks it's not only big enough to house an airplane, but even big enough to fly through it. Bill Kerman objected, Bob Kerman protested, and now Jebediah thinks we outta prove it.\n\nHe managed to convince Orville Kerman that the stunt was somehow for science, and he now has the keys back to the shed. Grinning, he says he's already moved the fuel tanks to a safer location, and that we're ready to try!
	
	synopsis = Go barnstorm Jebediah's tool shed near KSC.
	
	notes = Be sure your pilot signs off on the insurance waiver before attempting this one, as it's not covered.
	
	completedMessage = Amazing! You actually managed to fly an airplane through a building!\n\nYour pilot has earned some experience, and your organziation has gained some reputation for the stunt.
