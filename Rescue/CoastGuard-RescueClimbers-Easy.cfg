	group = KSC Coast Guard
	agent = KSC Coast Guard

	description = The KSC Coast Guard has received an emergency call from the Kerbin Peak Mountain Trail Ranger Station.&br;&br;Two mountain climbers are reported stranded on opposite summits of the K2 mountain range after they got in an arguement as to which way up K2 was the correct way. Apparently one climber has a rope, the other has hooks, and now they are both in need of a rescue. Send out a Search and Rescue team to rescue the climbers, and return them to a Coast Guard landing area for a safe recovery. Lt. Dan Kerman has assigned expert mountaineer Ens. Joe Kerman, to this mission to assist in the recovery of the climbers.

	synopsis = KSC Coast Guard: Our motto is Always Ready - Kemper Keratus!

	notes = Rescue climbers @/kerbalsInDistress.ElementAt(0) and @/kerbalsInDistress.ElementAt(1) from their respective locations in the K2 mountains, and bring them to any KSC Coast Guard rescue station for a safe recovery.

	completedMessage = KSC Coast Guard rescue mission accomplished!&br;&br;The climbers were retrieved from the mountain safely. They promise to stick together again next time.
