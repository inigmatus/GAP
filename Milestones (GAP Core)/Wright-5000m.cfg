//CONTRACT DESCRIPTION

//Contract Descriptions
	name = Wright-5000m
	title = Fly an airplane to 5,000m.
	group = Wright Aeronautical
	agent = Wright Aeronautical
	
	description = Orville Kerman says it should be possible now to attempt an altitude record of 5,000m in an air-breathing airplane. He said Wright Aeronautical is aware that a local newpaper is offering a reward to any organization that will be the first to achieve a 5,000m flying altitude, and he thinks your oraganization may be up to the task.
	
	synopsis = Simply launch an airplane from the runway, fly up to 5,000m, then land back at KSC safely.
	
	notes = Enjoy the view, as at this altitude things on the ground really start to look small!
	
	completedMessage = 5,000m and you didn't hit a bird! Great job!\n\nUnfortunatley, hitting a bird was what the last pilot to attemp this challenge said before he spirled out of control from 4,500m and left a crater near the Administration Building.\n\nAs Gene Kerman makes preparations to turn the crater into a memorial pond for aviation pioneers, both Orville Kerman and Inigma Kerman congratulate you on returning safely. Inigma says SSI has a challenge waiting for you back at Mission Control if you're interested.
