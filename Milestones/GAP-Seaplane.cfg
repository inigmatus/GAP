//CONTRACT DESCRIPTION

	name = GAP-Seaplane
	title = Build and fly a seaplane!
	group = GAP
	agent = Giving Aircraft a Purpose

	description = You've proven the airworthiness of your aircraft so far. But can you modify it or design an aircraft that can land on water? We want you to attempt an aviation first - landing an airplane on water, and taking back off again. Our engineers would like to call such an idea a seaplane, and they think it will really be useful to a number of organizations at KSC if the idea can be proven.

	synopsis = Land a seaplane on the surface of the water at the waypoint, and take off again and land back at KSC.

	notes = Your craft must be an airplane that can land on water horizontally and take off again.

	completedMessage = Congratulations on another aviation first! You have propelled your organization to one of the most popular organizations on Kerbin. GAP has credited your account with a share of funds from various investors who are excited about your organization's future.
