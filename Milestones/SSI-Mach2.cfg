//CONTRACT DESCRIPTION

//Contract Descriptions
	name = SSI-Mach2
	title = Achieve Mach 2!
	group = GAP
	agent = SSI Aerospace
	
	description = Mach Kerman believes with current liquid-fueled rocket technology, that it's possible to exceed Mach 2, which is twice the speed of sound. Doing so would bring SSI another step closer to spaceplane development. He wants you to take an airplane above 2,500m but below 20,000m and see if you can exceed Mach 2 safely in level controlled flight.
	
	synopsis = Launch an airplane from the runway, fly between 2,500m and 20,000m, exceed 686 m/s in level flight for 5 seconds, and then land back at KSC safely.
	
	notes = Going Mach 1 was cool. Going Mach 2 will be even cooler. Unfortunately, scientists at SSI and at KSC both predict it will also lead to twice the number of required autographs when you get back.
	
	completedMessage = Wow! You did it! You reached Mach 2, and came back safely!&br;&br;Inigma passed your flight data to Gene Kerman at the Kerbal Space Program, and Gene says he's very proud of your accomplishments, and that he's very glad to have you and SSI Aerospace working together.
