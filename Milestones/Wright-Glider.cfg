//CONTRACT DESCRIPTION

	name = Wright-Glider
	title = Build and fly a glider!
	group = GAP
	agent = Wright Aeronautical

	description = Wilbur and Orville Kerman have been overseeing GAP's flying machine project and have formed a new venture company called Wright Aeronautical to explore the frontiers of powered air flight. To get started, they want you to develop a prototype gilder to test a few flight control concepts. Your glider must have a command seat, wings to control its flight, and be able to land safely.&br;&br;Getting the glider up into the air is up to your imagination, however Jebediah Kerman recommends the tried and true solid rocket approach. That or jumping off a cliff. Your choice. Whatever you decide to do, just make sure your pilot survives as we don't want any bad publicity this early into our program. To be counted as a true glider, you will need to decouple any boosters you decide to use.

	synopsis = Making a glider isn't that hard. Getting it up off the ground, however, will present a challenge.

	notes = Jebediah hints that if you decide to go with a solid rocket launch assist, that you include a means to decouple the solid rockets for a smoother flight.

	completedMessage = The glider flight test was a success!&br;&br;The fact that you landed safely is even more amazing.
