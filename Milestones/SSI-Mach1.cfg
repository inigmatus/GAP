//CONTRACT DESCRIPTION

//Contract Descriptions
	name = SSI-Mach1
	title = Break the sound barrier!
	group = GAP
	agent = SSI Aerospace
	
	description = SSI Aerospace's chief scientist Mach Kerman, and KSP retired test pilot Yeager Kerman, want to push SSI toward developing a spaceplane. But before this can happen, Inigma Kerman of SSI says they need to master supersonic flight, and to do this, he is asking your organization to design a plane that can break through the sound barrier in level flight under 20,000m.&br;&br;Although not required to complete this challenge, Mach Kerman believes that if you design an airplane to use one of the new liquid fueled rocket engines being developed for use by the space program, might make this attempt easier to accomplish.
	
	synopsis = Launch an airplane from the runway, fly between 2,500m and 20,000m, exceed 343 m/s in level flight for 5 seconds, and then land back at KSC safely.
	
	notes = No one has ever gone faster than the speed of sound before, so most scientists and engineers are at a loss as to give you any useful advice. Even if they could, they're afraid you'd be traveling to fast to hear it anyways.
	
	completedMessage = You have broken the sound barrier and achieved the amazing speed of Mach 1! Don't worry, we're sure it can be fixed back up in a jiffy for the next guy!
