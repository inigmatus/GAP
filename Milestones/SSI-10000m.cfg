//CONTRACT DESCRIPTION

//Contract Descriptions
	name = SSI-10000m
	title = Fly an airplane to 10,000m.
	group = GAP
	agent = SSI Aerospace
	
	description = Inigma Kerman of SSI wants you to design and fly an aircraft capable of operating at an altitude of 10,000m. He says that such an accomplishment will make future air travel safer since most of Kerbin's serious weather only happens below this altitude. He says that if pilots could simply fly over bad weather rather than through it, it would unlock a large number of regional and possibly global air travel possibilities.
	
	synopsis = Simply launch an airplane from the runway, fly up to 10,000m, then land back at KSC safely.
	
	notes = Enjoy the view, as at this altitude the clouds (if any are seen today) will mostly be below your aircraft!
	
	completedMessage = You did it! 10,000m reached, and your pilot snapped a great picture!&br;&br;While your pilot rests up at the Astronaut Complex, be sure to check in with Gene at Mission Control for another SSI opportunity if interested.
