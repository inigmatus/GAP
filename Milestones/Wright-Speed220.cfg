//CONTRACT DESCRIPTION

//Contract Descriptions
	name = Wright-Speed220
	title = Achieve an airspeed of 220 m/s
	group = GAP
	agent = Wright Aeronautical
	
	description = Kurtis Kerman, now a fellow engineer with Wright Aeronautical, thinks that with additional tweaking of existing aircraft design, that it may be possible to exceed 220 m/s in level flight. A number of sponsors have given GAP some money to make it happen, and Inigma Kerman is more than happy to funnel all of it to Wright Aeronautical and on to your organization if you accept this contract!&br;&br;Attempting high speed flying though is not for the faint of heart. Some pilots have reported serious shimmies with their aircraft when approaching high speeds during dives, and some airplanes have broken up due to aerodynamic forces when exceeding 220 m/s. Inigma wants you to be the first to take an air-breathing airplane above 2,500m but below 5,000m and exceed 220 m/s in level controlled flight, and return safely. Doing so will give the sponsors a pretty decent return on their investment and funds in your pocket.
	
	synopsis = Simply launch an airplane from the runway, fly between 2,500m and 5,000m, exceed 220 m/s in level flight for 5 seconds, and then land back at KSC safely.
	
	notes = Let's get flying!
	
	completedMessage = Congratulations, you have set a new airspeed record of 220 m/s and returned alive!&br;&br;Your success in meeting Wright Aeronautical airspeed challenges has Inigma Kerman calling for you to see if you can help GAP surmount one of the most daring airspeed challenges ever conceived. Check in with Mission Control for details.
