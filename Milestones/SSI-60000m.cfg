//CONTRACT DESCRIPTION

//Contract Descriptions
	name = SSI-60000m
	title = Fly a spaceplane to the edge of space!
	group = GAP
	agent = SSI Aerospace
	
	description = The Kerbal Space Program wants SSI Aerospace to be the first to develop a spaceplane for use in its space program. Inigma Kerman already had you on speed dial, and is currently asking your organization to lead this cutting edge effort.&br;&br;Inigma says that you will need to develop a spaceplane - one that will be able to fly to the highest reaches of the atmosphere, and land on the ground safely. It's not that hard to say that 60,000m is a mere skip away from space. He says the Kerbal Space Program has already given authorization to make this a suborbital flight if desired - assuming you can engineer your spaceplane to do so, but it's not required to complete the mission.
	
	synopsis = Simply launch a spaceplane from the runway and fly up to 60,000m and then land your spaceplane anywhere on the ground safely. You may use an air-breathing engine, or liquid fueled engine, or both.
	
	notes = High above Kerbin, where space meets the air, and the stars beckon, will you realize that the universe is at your fingertips. That is, if Kerbals even have fingers other than their thumbs.
	
	completedMessage = Your spaceplane mission was a success! Mission Control erupted in celebration when you flew above 60,000m, and again when you landed. There are compliments all around, and your organization has been honored with a fairly large reward.
