//CONTRACT DESCRIPTION

	name = SSI-Submarine
	title = Build and test a submarine!
	group = SSI Aerospace
	agent = SSI Aerospace

	description = You've proven you can design and use a surface vessel, but Cornelius Kerman of Turtle Exploration Technologies, another new member of SSI, wonders about the possibilities of desinging an underwater craft. Inigma Kerman says SSI will provide funds for the effort, and invites your organization to partner with Turtle Exploration Technologies to develop the first ever practical underwater craft, or submarine.

	synopsis = Build and test a submarine and dive to 50m underwater, and come back up.

	notes = Your craft can be of any design, but must be able to submerge to 50m and come back to the surface.

	completedMessage = Congratulations on successfully testing the world's first practical submarine! Your engineer has earned some significant experience! KSC Island Tours is certianly interested in your project's success, and already has plans to commercialize your success, if you're interested. Check in with Mission Control for more details.
