//CONTRACT DESCRIPTION

	name = KSP-IslandLandingBD
	title = Operation: Manley Freedom
	group = Kerbal Space Program
	agent = Kerbal Space Program

	description = Gene Kerman says that a rogue group of snack hoarders calling themselves the Hackestream Brigade have kidnapped Scott Kerman and hijacked the KSC Island Airfield. They say the island is theirs now, and to protect their cache of snacks, they threaten to shoot down any plane that comes near the island. The Brigade apparently is using Scott Kerman to make broadcasts for their cause, but verbal analysis of his "fly safe" tag line has proven that he's being made to do so under duress.\n\nGene says that this course of action by the rogues is unacceptable. He is therefore asking your organization's help to rescue Scott Kerman, and return control of the island back to the Kerbal Space Center, but peacefully if possible. If the beligerents attack you while you attempt a landing, he says you are authorized to defend yourselves and the mission to rescue Scott Kerman, and re-claim the island by any means possible.\n\nThis mission requires that you accomplish each step sequentially, or else something may go wrong and the ending might not be a happy one for Scott Kerman or anyone involved with the rescue.
	
	synopsis = Load Special Agent Kirrim from the Tracking Center to gather intelligence on the ground at KSC Island, then launch a plane or squadron from KSC, neutralize any threat at KSC Island if necessary, land and rescue Scott Kerman, plant a flag at the base of the air tower, then take off and land back at KSC and recover Scott Kerman. Now that's a synopsis for you. Fly safe.

	notes = You are welcome to use anything and everything in your aresenal to accomplish the mission at hand, including bringing any allies along with you, or running multiple sorties if necessary. Just be sure that before you launch your first flight that you first contact our embedded agent at KSC Island so we can get an updated intelligence report of the situation on the ground.

	completedMessage = The mission was a success! Gene Kerman congratulates you on a successful rescue of Scott Kerman, and the restoring of KSC Island to Kerbal Space Center control. The remaining members of the Hackestream Brigade have escaped for now, but we will continue to seek them out and will hopefully be able to bring them all to justice.
